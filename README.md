# ngx-instagram-carousel

## Introduction

This project is created with my wedding in mind. It's meant for a simple carousel featuring publicly tagged images through live stream. It includes an angular component to display the date  and runs the carousel thereafter. Feel free to modify it for a countdown timer.

## Usage

As the instagram API does not return CORS header, you will need to run the API through a backend server or a *browser plugin to enable CORS*.

Feel free to fork and modify.
